Homework 3 - Movie Data

This repository was created to demonstrate the implementation of reading in a file, then parsing the data out into a hashmap
for data insights.

Author notes. This repository was created  for assignment 3 of CISC 3130. It is not completely how I want it yet, and is missing the
piece of assignment asking for the last 5 years. However, I plan to finish it.

Installation/Set-Up: Open all java files from MovieGenres folder within a project. Replace path of files (scanner & output stream) with desired path of files. Run program.

Dependencies: Java 8 & TSV file

Output: MovieDataOutput.txt contains program's output
